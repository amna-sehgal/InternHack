## Before You Start

1. **Read the README**, Understand what InternHack does and the tech stack
2. **Browse existing issues**, Look for `good first issue` or `help wanted` labels
3. **Check open PRs**, Make sure no one else is already working on the same thing
4. **Use the app**, Visit [internhack.xyz](https://www.internhack.xyz) to understand user flows before touching code

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

| Tool | Version | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| Node.js | 18+ | Runtime |
| npm | 9+ | Package manager |
| PostgreSQL | 14+ | Database |
| Git | 2.30+ | Version control |

**Docker Compose shortcut:** You can run Postgres + API + client with only Docker by following the README “Docker Compose (alternative)” section (root `.env.example` plus `docker compose up`). That path does **not** use Redis — the app stack is PostgreSQL only.

You'll also need:
- A **Google Cloud Console** project for OAuth (client ID)
- A **Gemini API key** ([free at aistudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey))

### Step 1: Fork and clone

```bash
# Fork the repo on GitHub, then:
git clone https://github.com/Sachinchaurasiya360/InternHack
cd InternHack
```

### Step 2: Set up environment variables

**Docker Compose:** copy the template at the repo root:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

**Classic setup:** separate client and server copies:

```bash
cp server/.env.example server/.env
cp client/.env.example client/.env
```


Open `server/.env` and fill in the **required** values:

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/internhack
JWT_SECRET=any-random-string-at-least-64-chars-long
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-oauth-client-id
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:5173
```

Open `client/.env` and fill in:

```env
VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-oauth-client-id
```

> **Note:** Only the variables above are required. Features like S3 uploads, payments, email, and code execution will degrade gracefully without their keys.

### Step 3: Install dependencies

```bash
# Install server dependencies
cd server && npm install

# Install client dependencies (in a new terminal)
cd client && npm install
```

### Step 4: Set up the database

Prisma config lives at `server/src/database/prisma.config.ts`, so **run all Prisma commands from `server/src/database/`**:

```bash
cd server/src/database

# Generate the Prisma client
npx prisma generate

# Push the schema to your database (creates all tables)
npx prisma db push
```

### Step 5: Seed data (optional but recommended)

```bash
cd server

# Seed everything, users, DSA, aptitude, companies, badges, skill tests,
# hackathons, open-source repos, gov internships, and blog posts
npm run seed

# Or seed only an admin + recruiter account
# (set ADMIN_EMAIL and ADMIN_PASSWORD in .env first)
npm run seed:admin
```

> The unified seed script lives at `server/src/database/seeds/seed.ts`. It is idempotent, you can run it multiple times without creating duplicates. Default password for all seeded accounts is `Test@1234`.
>
> **Seeded accounts:**
>
> | Email | Role | Plan | Notes |
> |---|---|---|---|
> | `admin@internhack.xyz` | Admin | Free | Super-admin with full dashboard access |
> | `recruiter@internhack.xyz` | Recruiter | Free | Pre-linked to TechCorp, can post jobs |
> | `aarav@example.com` | Student | Free | IIT Delhi, JavaScript/React/Node.js |
> | `priya@example.com` | Student | Free | NIT Trichy, Python/Django/ML |
> | `rohan@example.com` | Student | Free | BITS Pilani, Java/Spring Boot/AWS |
> | `sneha@example.com` | Student | Free | IIIT Hyderabad, TypeScript/React/PostgreSQL |
> | `arjun@example.com` | Student | Free | VIT Vellore, C++/DSA |
> | `premium@example.com` | Student | **Monthly (Active)** | Use this account to test all premium/subscription-gated features (AI roadmaps, cover letter generation, mock interviews, etc.) |

### Step 6: Start the dev servers

```bash
# Terminal 1, Backend (port 3000)
cd server && npm run dev

# Terminal 2, Frontend (port 5173)
cd client && npm run dev
```

Open **http://localhost:5173**, you're ready to develop!

## Understanding the Codebase

### High-level architecture

```
User (Browser)
  │
  ├── React Frontend (Vite, port 5173)
  │     └── Zustand stores, React Query, React Router
  │
  └── Express API (port 3000)
        ├── Middleware (auth, role, rate-limit, validation)
        ├── Modules (routes → controller → service)
        ├── Prisma ORM → PostgreSQL
        └── External APIs (Gemini, S3, Resend, etc.)
```

### Server module pattern

Every backend feature follows the same structure:

```
server/src/module/<name>/
├── <name>.routes.ts          # Route definitions + middleware
├── <name>.controller.ts      # Request handling, calls service
├── <name>.service.ts         # Business logic, DB queries
└── <name>.validation.ts      # Zod schemas for input validation
```

**To trace a feature:** Start at the route file, follow the controller method, then the service method. Validation schemas show you exactly what inputs are expected.

### Client module pattern

```
client/src/module/<area>/
├── <PageName>.tsx            # Page components
└── components/               # Page-specific sub-components
```

Shared components live in `client/src/components/`. State management uses Zustand (`lib/*.store.ts`) and data fetching uses React Query.

### Key files to read first

| File | What it tells you |
|------|-------------------|
| `server/src/index.ts` | All API routes, middleware order, CORS setup |
| `client/src/App.tsx` | All frontend routes and lazy-loaded pages |
| `server/src/database/prisma/schema/base.prisma` | Core database models |
| `client/src/lib/types.ts` | Client-side TypeScript interfaces |
| `.claude/REPO_MAP.md` | Detailed map of every module and file |

### How to trace a feature end-to-end

Let's say you want to understand how "Apply to Job" works:

1. **Client route**, Find the page in `App.tsx` → `JobDetailPage`
2. **API call**, In the page component, look for `api.post("/student/jobs/:id/apply")`
3. **Server route**, `server/src/module/student/student.routes.ts` → find the POST route
4. **Controller**, `student.controller.ts` → `applyToJob()` method
5. **Service**, `student.service.ts` → `applyToJob()`, the actual business logic
6. **Database**, Check `application` model in `base.prisma`

This pattern works for every feature.

## Making Changes

### Branch naming

```
feat/short-description     # New features
fix/short-description      # Bug fixes
docs/short-description     # Documentation
refactor/short-description # Code improvements
```

### Workflow

```bash
# Create a branch from main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name

# Make your changes, then:
git add <specific-files>
git commit -m "feat: short description of what and why"

# Push and open a PR
git push origin feat/your-feature-name
```

### Adding a new API endpoint

1. Create or update `<name>.routes.ts`, define the route with middleware
2. Create or update `<name>.controller.ts`, handle request/response
3. Create or update `<name>.service.ts`, write the business logic
4. Create or update `<name>.validation.ts`, add Zod schemas
5. Register routes in `server/src/index.ts` if it's a new module

### Adding a new client page

1. Create the page component in `client/src/module/<area>/<PageName>.tsx`
2. Add a lazy import in `client/src/App.tsx`
3. Add the route in the appropriate route group (public / student / recruiter / admin)

### Modifying the database

1. Edit the schema in `server/src/database/prisma/schema/`
2. Run `npx prisma generate` from `server/src/database/`
3. Run `npx prisma db push` to apply changes
4. **Do not** create migrations without discussing first, we use `db push` for development

## Code Style Guide

### TypeScript

- Strict mode is enabled on both client and server
- Use Zod for all server-side input validation
- Use proper types, avoid `any` where possible

### TailwindCSS (v4)

- Use canonical TailwindCSS v4 class names
- Use `bg-linear-to-*` instead of `bg-gradient-*`
- Don't use arbitrary values like `text-[17px]`, use the standard scale
- No gradient backgrounds on icons, use flat colors

### UI conventions

- Company avatars: first-letter initial in a neutral box, not a generic icon
- No pill badges (`rounded-full`) above page headings
- Dark mode support on all new components

### Commit messages

Use conventional commits:

```
feat: add external job pagination
fix: theme toggle not persisting on route change
docs: update contributing guide
refactor: extract email templates to utils
```

Keep messages short (under 72 chars), focused on **what** and **why**.
